- We use firebase because it does a lot of API integration automatically, else in other databases we will have to make separate APIs for login, authentications etc separately

- Firestore is used because...?

- flutter pub add firebase_core
flutter pub add firebase_auth
flutter pub add cloud_firestore
flutter pub add provider
flutter pub add firebase_ui_auth // Do not install this one yet

- npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase projects:list
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

- env -> Envirpnmental Variables -> Path -> New -> <Jo bhi path diya hua hai> -> Add -> OK -> OK

- Close terminal, then reopen it

- flutterfire configure
Select project -> android

- import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
